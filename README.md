# 100 Days of Python – Angela Yu
![](https://progress-bar.xyz/35/?scale=100&title=Progress&width=400&prefix=Day-&suffix=&progress_color=9CBF1F)  

This repository tracks my full journey through [**Angela Yu’s 100 Days of Python Bootcamp**](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/), including:

* Daily project folders (one per day, but the very first 10 lessons)
* Personal Daily Logs documenting what I learned, stored in `/logs/`
* Notes, improvements, and refactoring as I progress from beginner → advanced

The stack I am using is:

I’m building this as both a **learning archive** and a **public portfolio**.

Each day’s code lives in its own folder:

* `day_01/`
* `day_02/`
* `day_03/`
* ...
* `day_35/`

(Full TOC will be auto-generated once folders are added.)

## 🚀 Why This Repo Exists

I’m using GitHub to:

* Make my progress visible
