![](https://progress-bar.xyz/35/?scale=100&title=Progress&width=400&prefix=Day-&suffix=&progress_color=9CBF1F)

This repository tracks my full journey through Angela's course on Python, including:

* Daily project folders (one per day)
* Personal Daily Logs documenting what I learned, stored in `/logs/`
* Notes, improvements, and refactoring as I progress from beginner → advanced

The stack I am using is:  
![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.11-blue) ![PyCharm](https://img.shields.io/badge/pycharm-143?&logo=pycharm&logoColor=black&color=black&labelColor=green) ![Claude](https://img.shields.io/badge/Claude-D97757?&logo=claude&logoColor=white) ![ChatGPT](https://img.shields.io/badge/chatGPT-74aa9c?&logo=openai&logoColor=white)

**🏅 Focus:** Python · Automation · APIs · Tkinter · Data Handling  
**🎯 Goal:** Build senior-level fluency through 100 structured projects  
**📈 Next Steps (post-course):** Data Science fundamentals + Machine Learning (NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn)

---
I’m building this as both a **learning archive** and a **public portfolio**.

![Completed](https://img.shields.io/badge/Completed-34/100-green) [![Logs](https://img.shields.io/badge/Previous%20Logs-orange)](logs/) 
#### 🗓️ Day 35 – Keys, Authentication & Environment Variables
Today’s goal is to learn how to access protected APIs using authentication keys  
and how to keep credentials safe by loading them from environment variables instead of hard-coding them.

**Stack used:** Python · APIs · `python-dotenv` · Environment Variables  

### Upcoming goal
🔸 **Next Milestone**  
**Day 45** — Working on Intermediate Python Projects  

🔸 **Big Milestone**  
**Day 82** — Portfolio-ready Project

🔹 **FINAL GOAL**  
Complete all 100 days with full logs and code history.

## 🚀 Why This Repo Exists

I’m using GitHub to:

* Make my progress visible
* Build software discipline (commit → push → log → repeat)
* Keep everything portable across machines
* Create a strong public portfolio showing consistent learning

---

## 📌 Next Steps

* Import all my existing Daily Logs
* Build a full Daily Log TOC
* Add screenshots or highlights for bigger projects
* Expand README as I progress
